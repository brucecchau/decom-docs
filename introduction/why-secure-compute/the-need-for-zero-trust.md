# The Need for Zero Trust

The security concerns raised by the Emergen Research paper are very real. Web3 users are currently faced with a ‘User Beware’ situation and risk losing the funds in their wallet every time they connect their wallets and transact with a current-generation DApp. There are numerous stories of users finding their wallets emptied due to what they thought was a legitimate site and transaction or signature.

Fake sites, fake social media channels and fake project documentation are other areas of risk for web3 users as it is very difficult to determine if a site is authentic or not or whether the site content was compromised.

In order for the optimistic web3 projections to come true, projects need to truly live up to the DOVE principles (Decentralization, Ownership, Verifiability, Execution) because the security problems being faced are due to the neglect of these principles.

Current ‘so-called’ web3 DApps have the following architecture:

As one can see, most current Web3 DApps simply bolt on a wallet and some integration with blockchain smart contracts, but they still leverage the same centralized web 2.0 infrastructure for everything else, thereby creating the problem. Notably, there is no transparency on how the DApp is hosted, no transparency on what code is being served and no transparency on how the migration process for the DApp was handled. In other words, users need to blindly trust the centralized entities that still play a large role in current web3 DApps.

To fully live up to the web3 vision, there is a need for a Zero Trust approach that leverages the DOVE principles and enables the public to ‘validate’ DApps, Documents and social media accounts without the need to ‘Trust’ any centralized authority.

In an ideal web3 world, users should be able to self-validate and access the following:

* Proof that the URL of the DApp site is legitimate and hasn’t been tampered with&#x20;
* Proof that DApp has been audited by a 3rd party and see the results of the audit&#x20;
* Audit trail of the version of code that is being served&#x20;
* Confirmation that the DApp being served up has not been tampered with&#x20;
* Details of which smart contracts that the DApp interacts with&#x20;
* Confirmation that the associated project documents and social media accounts are authentic
