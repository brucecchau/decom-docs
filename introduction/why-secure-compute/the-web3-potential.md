# The Web3 Potential

Web3 is a term that is commonly agreed to encompass the next evolution of the internet incorporating concepts such as decentralization and token-based economics. More specifically, it is often envisioned to support the DOVE principles: &#x20;

* **D**ecentralization: Lack of a single controlling authority
* **O**wnership: Users being gatekeepers of their own assets and credentials&#x20;
* **V**erifiability: Public ability to self-verify transactions and data&#x20;
* **E**xecution: Ability to execute code without intermediaries

From a market size perspective, Emergen Research in June 2022, estimated the global Web3 market size at USD 3.2 Billion in 2021 and forecasts the growth at a CAGR of 43.7% reaching USD 81.5 Billion by 2030. \

A key caveat that they noted in their research is the need for existing websites to modernize and the concerns over the potential for a significant increase in online abuse and fraud.
