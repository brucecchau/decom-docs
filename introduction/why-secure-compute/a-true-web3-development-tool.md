# A True Web3 Development Tool

Current blockchain projects have a difficult time living up to the full DOVE principles due to a lack of true Web3 DApp development infrastructure. Increasingly there are web3 infrastructure projects emerging that offer decentralized and transparent approaches for accessing blockchains, however, that is typically as far as they go.

The DApp Front End and middleware are typically still built using traditional web 2.0 approaches, namely leveraging web 2.0 frameworks like REACT, VUE.JS etc and the resulting DApp is also often hosted on centralized hosting solutions that provide little transparency to end users.

Another problem that plagues the DApp development environment is the clinging to the Web2.0 development approach of ‘anything goes’. Existing frameworks like REACT, VUE.JS etc., promote its ability to allow developers to build as they wish using nested libraries of code that lead to unlimited flexibility but come at a cost of being almost impossible to ‘audit’ and ‘endless’ hacking risks from the libraries of unreviewed and unaudited code.

Unless there is a change in this approach, security risks and adoption risks of web3 will put the anticipated USD 81.5B industry at risk.
