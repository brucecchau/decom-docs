# Overview of Secure Compute

Secure Compute is the worldâ€™s first Zero Trust DApp Stack and the first to enable Web3 DApps that truly live up to the Web 3 DOVE principles (Decentralization, Ownership, Verifiability, Execution).

With Secure Compute, projects are able to tamper-proof their project information, DApps and project documentation and enable web3 users the ability to self-validate the authenticity of DApps, Documents and social media accounts.
