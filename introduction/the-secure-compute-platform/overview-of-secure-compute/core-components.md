# Core Components

Secure Compute is a platform that consists of several components.

* **VALID Registry**: Smart-contract based registries storing an immutable record of DApp configurations and project related information to enable users to independently validate the authenticity of DApps, Docs and more.
* **VALID Portal**: The VALID portal enables web3 users to conveniently confirm the authenticity of DApps, Docs and more from a single convenient site. The portal will also provide instructions to users to further self-validate directly from blockchain explorers for the so-inclined. Validators will also use the portal to carry out validation activities.
* **VALIDapps**: A DApp development protocol designed to make DApps easy to audit and assemble using reusable components.
* **VALIDocs**: A decentrally hosted, tamper-proof project documentation alternative to services such as GitBook.
* **VALID Nodes**: A decentralized network of transparent nodes that serve as DApp serving points and processors.
* **Decentralized Storage (IPFS/Arweave)**: Immutable decentralized solution protocols such as IPFS or Arweave serve as a key piece of the Secure Compute solution. Note that in this document IPFS is used, but other decentralized storage solutions may be leveraged.
