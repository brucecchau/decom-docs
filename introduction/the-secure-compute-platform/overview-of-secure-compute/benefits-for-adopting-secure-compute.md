# Benefits for Adopting Secure Compute

Secure Compute is a protocol that is designed to enable blockchain projects to offer more secure, transparent and validatable solutions to their community while themselves benefiting from:

* **Reduced Risks & Peace-of-mind** - By registering with Secure Compute and using its protocol, project owners will gain greater protection from phishing attacks, insider sabotage and external hacks against their DApps, documents and social media accounts.
* **Greater Decentralization** - Blockchain projects by nature often tout their decentralized credentials but often need to resort to non-transparent, centralized approaches for their DApp hosting and other processes. With Secure Compute, DApps are decentrally hosted, decentrally audited and all aspects of the DApp are transparently registered on a public blockchain.
* **Funding & Exposure Opportunities** - Blockchain projects participating in Secure Compute can qualify for grants from the SC Foundation and also have the ability to further attract funding from other ecosystem participants.
* **Public confirmation of stance on Security** - Participation in Secure Compute is a signal to the public that security and transparency matters.
