# Ecosystem Members

Secure Compute is a community-driven ecosystem, called the ‘VALIGLATORS’ that are incentivized through a $VALID utility token and common guiding objective of bringing greater decentralization, transparency, accountability and security to the web3 ecosystem through the following roles:

* **VALID Node Operators**: Node operators provide the technical computing resources for the hosting VALIDocs and VALIDapps and also host the VALID Portal. Node Operators are compensated for their services through fees collected from projects they service.
* **VALIDators**: VALIDators sign and authenticate registered information such as social media accounts and url domains to protect against phishing attacks. VALIDators are compensated by a ‘VAlidate-to-earn’ mechanism that rewards VALIDators for verifying validity of project information.
* **VALID Auditors**: A decentralized network of Auditors familiarized with the Secure Compute platform, perform audits on VALIDapps to ensure that registered information is accurate and that key DApp vulnerabilities are addressed before they can be introduced. SC Auditors are compensated from the projects they audit.
* **VALID Curators**: Curators are typically VCs, incubators, launchpads or web3 project stakeholders that use their $VALID token holding to ‘signal’ projects that are deserving of a project grant and in the process earn an APY%-based reward for their staked support.
* **VALID Ambassadors**: Ambassadors evangelize, train and support new entrants to the Secure Compute ecosystem.
