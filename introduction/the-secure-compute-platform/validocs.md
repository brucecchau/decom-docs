# VALIDocs

## VALIDoc Features:

VALIDocs offer the following key behind-the-scenes features that are lacking in other document platforms like Gitbook:

* **Tamper-proof Content**: All content to be published is first immutably stored in decentralized storage such as IPFS before publishing ensuring that content cannot be changed.
* **Decentralized Content Publishing**: A structured publishing process ensures that proper steps have been taken to ensure the authenticity of the content and transparency of the publishing process
* **Permissionless Hosting**: Projects only need to ensure that the Hosting Bucket is sufficiently funded to ensure that content is published through the decentralized network of nodes.
* **Integration with GitBook**: Project can be easily migrated from GitBook and projects may continue to leverage the lower cost versions of GitBook to maintain content if so desired.
