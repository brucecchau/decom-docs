# VALID Registry

The VALID Registry is a smart contract and IPFS based record of project information, VALIDApp configuration, Domain configuration and Secure-Compute based accounts/wallets. A decentralized community of VALIDators and Auditors will validate the information providing the web3 community with an accurate ‘authenticated’ registry of blockchain project information.
