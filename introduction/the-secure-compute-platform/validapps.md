# VALIDapps

VALIDapps are DApps built with the Secure Compute development protocol. VALIDapps, to the casual web3 user may look the same as a typical DApp but behind the covers, there are many differences. VALIDapps are Zero Trust DApps that enable its users to confirm its authenticity and have in-built circuit breaker mechanisms to ensure that DApps have not been tampered with.

## VALIDapp Features&#x20;

VALIDapps offer the following key behind-the-scenes features that are lacking in other DApps:

* **Auditable Framework**: Unlike DApps built using common Web 2.0 approaches such as React, Vue.JS, angular JS etc, VALIDapps are structured to be easily audited, both from the source-code structure to its usage of reusable web-components.
* **Decentralized Migration Process**: Projects teams may or may not have a structured source code management and migration process as most projects do not disclose or make such processes transparent. This can lead to inadvertent mistakes that lead to unintended vulnerabilities. VALIDappâ€™s require that source code versions be frozen into IPFS storage and audited before they can be hosted, ensuring that all VALIDapps have transparent and structured code migration procedures in place.
* **Audited before decentrally hosted**: All VALIDapps must be audited by independent auditors and hosted on a secure and transparent decentralized network.
* **Tamper-proof circuit breakers**: VALID nodes carry out authenticity checks each time it serves up the DApp and will not serve if any tampering is detected (ie code or domain no longer matches what is in the blockchain registry)

VALIDapps retain the versatility of existing DApps, as literally all current features that current DApps offer to end users can be duplicated using the VALIDApp approach.
