# Charts

A chart is a graphical representation for data visualization, in which "the data is represented by symbols, such as bars in a bar chart, lines in a line chart, or slices in a pie chart". A chart is a type of diagram that organizes and represents a set of numerical or qualitative data.   It provides a mean to easily understand large amount of data and the relationships between parts of the data.

The following charting components are the most commonly used chart types.
## Bar Chart
[`i-bar-chart`](components/charts/BarChart/README.md) is a component to create bar chart that presents categorical data with rectangular bars with heights or lengths proportional to the values that they represent. The bars can be plotted vertically or horizontally.  A bar chart shows comparisons among discrete categories. One axis of the chart shows the specific categories being compared, and the other axis represents a measured value. 
## Stack Bar Chart 
[`i-bar-stack-chart`](components/charts/BarStackChart/README.md) is a component that creates a stacked bar chart to represent the proportional contribution of individual data points in comparison to a total. The height or length of each bar represents how much each group contributes to the total.
## Line Chart
[`i-line-chart`](components/charts/LineChart/README.md) is a component that
## Pie Chart
[`i-pie-chart`](components/charts/PieChart/README.md) is the component to create a pie chart that is a circle divided into areas, or slices. Each slice represents the count or percentage of the observations of a level for the variable. 
## Scatter Chart
[`i-scatter-chart`](components/charts/ScatterChart/README.md) is a component that create a scatter chart that plots the dots representing values for two different numeric variables. The position of each dot on the horizontal and vertical axis indicates values for an individual data point. Scatter plots are used to observe relationships between variables.
## Scatter Line Chart
[`i-scatter-line-chart`](components/charts/ScatterLineChart/README.md) is a component that creates a scatter line chart that based on the scatter chart with an additional line showing the correlation of the two variables.
